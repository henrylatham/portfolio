I've spent the last 6 years as a product founder & strategist honing my own philosophy for being effective at building successful products. That journey has taken me to a plethora of teams across four continents, working in diverse teams & working environments.

I believe that much of modern work culture makes us less effective, and that to build successful products we must start by changing our foundations:

First, by changing our own beliefs. Second, by changing the beliefs and actions of our team. Third, applying the right process to help us make the best decision possible at each instance.

That philosophy is now one I promulgate within the design & product world, both as a thought leader & strategist working with individual companies:

+ A talk to 400 designers on [how to focus on being more effective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=espOkcM94g4) in Berlin, 2018.
